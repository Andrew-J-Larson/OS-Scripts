# Windows Sandbox (Dark Theme)
You should be able to use the `Launch Windows Sandbox (Dark Theme).bat` anywhere on your computer, but the `Sandbox` folder needs to be copied to the root of the drive (C:), which should be easily taken care of if you use the `Install.bat` script.

A working shortcut file should be available and working after the install, in the `Sandbox` folder.

`Windows (dark).deskthemepack` is not used, but left as a reference since it was needed to create the dark mode for Windows 10's version of the sandbox.
