# Windows Sandbox (Dark Theme)
The `Sandbox` folder needs to be copied to the root of the drive (`C:`), which should be easily taken care of if you use the `Install.bat` script.

A working shortcut file that you can use anywhere on your computer is located under: `C:\Sandbox`

`Windows (dark).deskthemepack` is not used, but left as a reference since it was needed to create the dark mode for Windows 10's version of the sandbox.
