# Older Versions

These versions of the shortcut work fine, but aren't as nice as the latest version, but they still could be useful for someone else I suppose.

## Extra Info

The `embedded-resources` contains only files that were used to embed into the script (they aren't read by the script, and doesn't need to be downloaded).
The `img0_3840x2160.jpg` wallpaper inside that folder is for the **Windows 10** sandbox version, as the launch version of the desktop background had a nicer darker appearance.
- NOTE: The clipboard is utilized in order to load in the wallpaper without mounting any folders
