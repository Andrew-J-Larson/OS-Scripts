## Supported Applications

Use the following script to recreate the app shortcuts for the startmenu:
 - https://github.com/Andrew-J-Larson/OS-Scripts/blob/main/Windows/Microsoft-Endpoint-Defender/Recreate-Startmenu-Shortcuts.ps1

If deploying via Intune, please instead using the following script (requires internet access):
 - https://github.com/Andrew-J-Larson/OS-Scripts/blob/main/Windows/Microsoft-Endpoint-Defender/Recreate-Startmenu-Shortcuts-INTUNE.ps1

By default, a shortcut won't be made for programs that aren't installed, so rest assured, you won't have random app shortcuts created.

The script does make a log at the root of the machine it was ran on, likely located at `C:\Recreate-Startmenu-Shortcuts.log`. If you are going to submit a bug report, please include this file, as it's generally very handy for me to diagnose the issue.

If some of your users have issues with pins opening up as duplicated icons on the taskbar, look into using this script (resets taskbar, but still requires manual intervention to set the pins back up on their account):
 - https://github.com/Andrew-J-Larson/OS-Scripts/blob/main/Windows/Microsoft-Endpoint-Defender/Reset-Taskbar-Pins.ps1

If you wish to contribute, either look at the code and add in entries manually, or you can look at [this script I made (Function-Generate-Lnk-Info.ps1)](https://github.com/Andrew-J-Larson/OS-Scripts/blob/main/Windows/Microsoft-Endpoint-Defender/Function-Generate-Lnk-Info.ps1), that has functions for generating shortcut(s) info in a format compatible with this recreation script.
