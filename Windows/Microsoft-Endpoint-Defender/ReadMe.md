## Supported Applications

Use the following script to recreate the app shortcuts for the list of applications below.
 - https://github.com/TheAlienDrew/OS-Scripts/blob/master/Windows/Microsoft-Endpoint-Defender/Recreate-Base-Shortcuts.ps1
 
By default, a shortcut won't be made for programs that aren't installed, so rest assured, you won't have random app shortcuts created.

The script does make a log at the root of the machine it was ran on, likely located at `C:\Recreate-Base-Shortcuts.log`. If you are going to submit a bug report, please include this file, as it's generally very handy for me to diagnose the issue.

If you wish to contribute, either look at the code and add in entries manually, or you can look at [this script I made (Function-Generate-Lnk-Info.ps1)](https://github.com/TheAlienDrew/OS-Scripts/blob/master/Windows/Microsoft-Endpoint-Defender/Function-Generate-Lnk-Info.ps1), that has functions for generating shortcut(s) info in a format compatible with this recreation script.
