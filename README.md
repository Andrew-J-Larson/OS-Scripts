# Shell Scripts and Commands
This is where I put down files that I find/create that might be useful in the future.

There will be .BAT/.CMD and .SH files where I feel need fit (that don't belong to a particular project). Like, imagine this repo as a library of scripting functions, sorta...

Files that can be used on OS's:
- Windows: .PS1 (Always), .BAT/.CMD (Always), .SH (Sometimes: Usually for WSL's Bash/POSIX)
- Linux: .SH (Always: Usually Bash, otherwise POSIX), .PS1 (Sometimes: if powershell-core is installed)
- Mac: .SCPT (Always: Usually AppleScript 2.0+), .SH (Always: Usually Zsh, otherwise Bash/POSIX), .APP (Sometimes; Usually script files bound together by Automator)

Scripts that are specific to platform lie within their platform folder, while scripts that can be used on more than one system are put in the cross-platform folder.
