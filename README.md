# Custom Shell Scripts and Commands
This is where I put down files that I find/create that might be useful in the future.

There will be .BAT/.CMD and .SH files where I feel need fit (that don't belong to a particular project). Like, imagine this repo as a library of scripting functions, sorta...

Files that can be used on OS's:
- Windows: .BAT (Always), .CMD (Always), .SH (sometimes/for those that have WSL)
- Linux: .SH (Always)
- Mac: .SH (sometimes/if it's posix compatible)

The folder line up is, if the script(s) can't be used on more than 1 OS, then it goes to it's respective OS folder, otherwise it'll go into the cross-platform folder.
