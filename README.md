# OS Scripts
This is where I'll put my custom scripts/functions that might be useful in future projects of mine.

Scripts/Apps that can be used on each OS:
- Windows: .PS1 (Always), .BAT/.CMD (Always), .SH (Sometimes: Usually for WSL's Bash/POSIX)
- Linux: .SH (Always: Usually Bash, otherwise POSIX), .PS1 (Sometimes: if Powershell is installed)
- Mac: .SCPT (Always: Usually AppleScript 2.0+), .SH (Always: Usually Zsh, otherwise Bash/POSIX), .APP (Sometimes; Usually script files bound together by Automator)

Scripts that are specific to platform lie within their platform folder, while scripts that can be used on more than one system are put in the cross-platform folder.
