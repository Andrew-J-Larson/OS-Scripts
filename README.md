# Shell Scripts and Commands
This is where I put down files that I find/create that might be useful in the future.

There will be .BAT/.CMD and .SH files where I feel need fit (that don't belong to a particular project). Like, imagine this repo as a library of scripting functions, sorta...

Files that can be used on OS's:
- Windows: .BAT (Always), .CMD (Always), .SH (Sometimes: Usually for WSL's Bash/POSIX)
- Linux: .SH (Always: Usually Bash, otherwise POSIX)
- Mac: .SCPT (Always: Usually AppleScript 2.0+), .SH (Always: Usually Zsh, otherwise POSIX)

The folder line up is, if the script(s) can't be used on more than 1 OS, then it goes to it's respective OS folder, otherwise it'll go into the cross-platform folder.
