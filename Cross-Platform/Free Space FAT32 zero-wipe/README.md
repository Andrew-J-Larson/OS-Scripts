# Free Space FAT32 zero-wipe
Clears the free space on FAT32 systems (such as many USB drives).

Attention WSL Users: sometimes when mounting a drive temporarily (when it's not already been mounted), it won't successfully unmount the drive. In this case, you just need to usually exit all instances of the terminal and then try to unmount it at the given directory on screen. I can't fix this as this is a bug on Microsoft's/Canonical's part when they created WSL. WSL 2.0 may or may not fix this, when it comes out.
