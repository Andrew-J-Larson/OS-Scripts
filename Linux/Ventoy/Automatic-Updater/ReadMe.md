## VentoyUpdater.sh

This script is meant to only auto-update linux instances of the Ventoy imaging tool.

You can either download this, and include it in the same location as Ventoy2Disk.sh, or you can use this to download the linux application by making a folder, e.g. "ventoy", moving this script into that folder, and starting it.
